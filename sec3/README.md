# Section 3

The section is split into 2 parts - a mini lecture to recap the structure of the stack and some basic assembly, and 4 basic programs to help you get familiar with parsing assembly code to understand what happens to the stack when each of the programs are run.

## `stack1`

Basic program with no inputs and no function calls, uses basic arithmetic.

## `stack2`

Program with a function that has inputs, uses some conditional statements.

## `stack3`

Slight more complex program that has a function calling another (which takes no inputs), uses a loop

## `stack4`

More complicated program involving a function call to another function that takes in two inputs, and uses some interesting conditional statements as well as a loop
